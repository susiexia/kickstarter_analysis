# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## The Purpose of project
1. Help Louise plan her crowdfunding campaign for her play Fever with estimated budget over $10,000.
2. Analyze by using several Excel measures of organization, sorting, filtering, visualizations as well as statistic.
3. Provides some solid information and uncovers dataset trends to Louise to help inform her campaign strategy.
## Data analysis on Excel sheets

### Descriptive Statistic
* This descriptive statistic uncovered central tendency and spread of US play campaign, which comparing successful outcomes to failed projects. As we can see, those failed campaigns have higher average goal as well as much higher standard deviation than successful campaign. However in pledged section, failed campaigns have lower average and median as well as IQR than successful campaign.

### Challenge
According to further analysis, there are several conclusions we can made based on our analysis.
#### Outcomes based on goals:

 The above line chart illustrates the percentage of each plays project outcomes based on their goal's amount.
 [counts_plays_outcomes.JPG](/counts_plays_outcomes.JPG)
 The above table shows the counts of each plays project outcomes based on their goal's amount.

* At a glance, the percentage successful has two spikes while the goal *less than 1000* as well as the range between *35000 to 44999*, 76% and 67% respectively. However, the percentage successful is decreasing to reach a lower point around 20% at *25000 to 29999* and get the lowest zero rate in *45000 to 49999*.
* In parallel to that, the percentage failed is relatively increasing to 80% at *25000 to 29999* and 100% when goal reaches the range of *45000 to 49999*.
* Since our client Louise crowdfunding goal is *over 10,000*, we need to focus to the range of *10000 to 14999*. There is a decreasing trend but the successful rate greater than the percentage of failed in that specific range.

#### Outcomes based on launch date:
>[Outcomes_Launch_Date.JPG](/Outcomes_Launch_Date.JPG)
* As we can see, the above line chart displays both of May and June have more successful theater outcomes through the years. Besides of summer time, starting a crowdfunding project might not perform well. In addition, November and December might be the worst launch time.
* Based on our analysis, I recommend Louise should start her crowdfunding project in May or Jun.

#### Acknowledge Limitation:
* So far, we have organized and sorted the data, and using two line charts to reveal trends that how a successful project related to the initial goal as well as launch date. However, there still are several limitation. For example, there might be many kind of plays under the plays subcategory, we need other dataset to narrow down.
* We need other tables and charts to uncover whether the length of each project have any significant effect to outcomes.
* Furthermore, we can figure out if there any trends between the successful outcomes and the number of backers as well as the location.
